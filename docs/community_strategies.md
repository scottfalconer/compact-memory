# Community Strategies Showcase

The Compact Memory framework is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create and share their own unique compression strategies. This page aims to showcase strategies developed and shared by our community.

We encourage you to explore these strategies and see how they might fit your use cases!

## How to Get Your Strategy Listed

If you have developed a compression strategy package for Compact Memory and would like to have it listed here, please follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Your Package is Ready:**
    *   Your strategy should be packaged correctly (e.g., following the structure similar to `examples/sample_strategy_package`).
    *   It should have a clear `README.md` explaining what the strategy does, how to install it (if it has dependencies beyond Compact Memory), and how to use it.
    *   The package should be publicly accessible (e.g., in a GitHub repository).
2.  **Submit a Pull Request:**
    *   Fork the main Compact Memory repository.
    *   Create a new branch for your addition.
    *   Edit this file (`docs/community_strategies.md`) to add an entry for your strategy under the "Available Strategies" section below. Please follow the existing format.
    *   Commit your changes and open a Pull Request to the main Compact Memory repository.
    *   In your Pull Request description, provide a brief overview of your strategy and a link to its repository.

We'll review your submission and, if everything looks good, merge it to include your strategy in this showcase!

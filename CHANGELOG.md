# Changelog

## Breaking Changes
- CLI `compress` command now requires explicit input flags: `--text`, `--file`, or `--dir`. Positional auto-detection has been removed.

## Enhancements
- Terminology standardized: documentation and CLI now consistently refer to compression engines, replacing the leftover “CompressionStrategies” term.

# TODO

This file tracks outstanding work based on `AGENTS.md`.

## Prototype memory system
 - Update prototypes via EMA and add health checks for splitting or merging. *(partial: EMA implemented, health checks pending)*
- Implement memory/prototype decay and conflict resolution flows. *(pending)*

## Retrieval pipeline
- Add two-tier retrieval with fine re-ranking or raw memory lookup. *(done)*
- Provide decoding of prototypes into human-readable summaries. *(done)*

## Memory creation and embeddings
- Support pluggable memory creation engines (LLM summary, chunking, extractive). *(done)*

## Research and evaluation
- Benchmark prototype-based retrieval vs raw memory retrieval.
- Determine effective Ï„ adaptation heuristics.
- Compare memory_text representation strategies.
- Evaluate methods for decoding prototype meaning.

## CLI and usability
- Expose configuration options (threshold, embedding model, memory creator). *(done)*
- Allow configuration of adaptive threshold parameters. *(done)*
- Improve documentation and installation instructions. *(done)*

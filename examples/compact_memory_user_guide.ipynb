    "#### Understanding the Script and Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "The script above performs the following actions:\n",
    "- It takes the `folder_path` you specified in the preceding cell.\n",
    "- It constructs and executes a single `compact-memory compress` command using the `--dir` option. This tells `compact-memory` to find and process all supported files (typically text-based files like `.txt`, `.md`, etc.) within the given directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "- The `first_last` engine is used with a budget of `200` tokens for the content from the directory.\n",
    "- The output from the command (compressed text, summaries, or errors) is printed below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customization Options:**\n",
    "- **Engine**: Change `--engine first_last` to another engine like `--engine none` or `--engine stopword_pruner` based on your needs.\n",
    "- **Budget**: Adjust `--budget 200` to a different token limit for the combined content or per-file basis if the engine/CLI supports it with `--dir`.\n",
    "- **Output**: To save the compressed output, you can add the `--output` flag to the `command` list in the script (e.g., `\"--output\", \"/content/drive/MyDrive/compressed_output.json\"`). The exact format and structure of the output when using `--dir` (e.g., a single file containing all results, or multiple files) depends on the `compact-memory` tool's implementation. You may need to consult `compact-memory compress --help` or experiment to see how output is structured for directory compression.\n",
    "- **File Selection**: The `--dir` option typically processes files `compact-memory` recognizes. If you need finer control over which files are included or excluded (e.g., specific glob patterns), you would need to check if the `compact-memory` CLI supports additional flags for this with `--dir` (e.g., `--glob \"*.txt\"` or `--exclude \"*.log\"`). If not, and you need very specific filtering, you might revert to a script that iterates files manually (like the previous version of this example) and calls `compact-memory compress --file` for each desired file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "The script will print a message indicating it's attempting to process the directory. This will be followed by the standard output and standard error from the `compact-memory` command. This output might include a summary of processed files, the compressed content (or a path to it if saved to a file), and any errors or warnings encountered during processing. At the end, a message \"--- Processing Complete ---\" or an error summary will be shown by the Python script."
